        Unit Tests: Write unit tests for <FILE>. Test each function in the file. Make sure to test edge cases.
        Bugs: The bug might be in <FILE>. Here are the logs: ...
        Features: the new endpoint should use the ... class from <FILE> because it contains ... logic.

        Focus on working, varifyable, and testable code and do not afford too much thought to things you don't understand or, more-likley, which don't actually make sense.

You can assume something unfamilliar is a placeholder and/or is out of scope, at any-time, and at your-own discretion.
