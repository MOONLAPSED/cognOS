# Project Name

This is a project for XYZ.

## Instructions

...
### db example:
CREATE TABLE Entity_ (
    entity_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    entity_name TEXT,
    entity_type_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Type_(type_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Attribute_ (
    attribute_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    attribute_name TEXT,
    attribute_type_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Type_(type_id)
);

CREATE TABLE EntityAttributes_UFS (
  entity_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Entity_(entity_id),
  ufs_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES ufs(ufs_id),
  PRIMARY KEY (entity_id, ufs_id)
  );

/* Relationships between Entities and Specific Object Data/bridges:
The bridge tables serve as a way to connect entities to UFS objects and other advanced entities, such as embeddings and Runtime_Agents. 
`"entity --> UFS ... entity --> bridge <-- UFS ... <--entity"` depicts a representation of the relationships between these entities.
Entity --> UFS: This direct relationship represents the connection between an entity and a UFS object. A UFS object captures information about a specific entity's state or behavior within the Unix File System.

Entity --> Bridge <-- UFS: This indirect relationship is mediated by the bridge table. The bridge table allows you to associate multiple UFS objects with a single entity, providing a more comprehensive view of the entity's interactions with the Unix File System.
Entity --> Bridge <-- Runtime_Agent: This relationship associates Runtime_Agents with entities. Runtime_Agents are yet to be coded, but they are expected to represent some type of dynamic or active entity that interacts with the system. */
# Instructions
To build and run the Docker image, follow these steps:
    entity_type_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Type_(type_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Attribute_ (
    attribute_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    attribute_name TEXT,
    attribute_type_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Type_(type_id)

CREATE TABLE EntityAttributes_UFS (
  entity_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Entity_(entity_id),
  ufs_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES ufs(ufs_id),
  PRIMARY KEY (entity_id, ufs_id)
  );

# Instructions
To build and run the Docker image, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd repository
```

3. Build the Docker image:
```
docker build -t image_name .
```

4. Run the Docker container:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 image_name
```

5. Access the application in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

Make sure to replace `username/repository` with the actual repository URL and `image_name` with the desired name for your Docker image.
Entity --> Bridge <-- Embedding: Similar to the UFS relationship, this indirect connection allows you to link multiple embeddings to a single entity. Embeddings represent the entity's content or features in a vectorized form, enabling efficient processing and analysis.

Entity --> Bridge <-- Runtime_Agent: This relationship associates Runtime_Agents with entities. Runtime_Agents are yet to be coded, but they are expected to represent some type of dynamic or active entity that interacts with the system. */

## Authentication and Image Pulling Instructions

To authenticate and pull the image from the repository, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to authenticate with the repository:
   ```
   docker login <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the repository.
3. Enter your username and password when prompted.

4. Once authenticated, you can pull the image using the following command:
   ```
   docker pull <image-name>:<tag>
   ```
   Replace `<image-name>` with the name of the image and `<tag>` with the desired version or tag.

That's it! You have successfully authenticated and pulled the image from the repository.
