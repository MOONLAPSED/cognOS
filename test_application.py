Test suite for the Application module.

This module (`test_application.py`) contains a series of unit tests designed to verify the
behavior and reliability of the Application module within cognosis. It aims to thoroughly
test each public function and class method to ensure they perform expectedly when faced
with typical, boundary, and edge cases. By simulating a variety of scenarios, these tests
validate the resilience and correctness of the application logic, contributing to the
overall quality assurance process of the project.

The tests are structured to cover:
- Basic functionality and correctness of each public method.
- Input validation and error handling.
- Correct handling of edge cases and exceptional conditions.
- Integration points with other modules, if applicable.

Each test function within this module is named to clearly indicate the specific functionality
or scenario it targets. This enhances the maintainability of the test suite and facilitates
diagnostic processes when identifying and addressing potential issues.
