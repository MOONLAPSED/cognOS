# cognosis chat

chat-ops is the abstract interface for 'chat' workflows which allow the realtime function-calling of cognosis. 

GO-flottbot is the candidate, right now. I'm looking for something that works its best at the terminal, not slack or some specific chat-app,  I really dont even care about chat apps - ssh would probably be the best protocol!
