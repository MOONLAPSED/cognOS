Keys: Keys are often used for identification and lookup purposes. Common mathematical functions applicable to keys include:

Hashing: Hash functions convert keys into unique integer values, enabling efficient lookup in data structures like hash tables.

Comparison: Keys can be compared for equality, less-than, greater-than, or other comparison operations, which is essential for sorting and searching.

String manipulation: Keys may be strings, and functions like substring extraction, character conversion, and length calculation can be used to process them.

Values: Values represent the actual data stored in a data structure. Common mathematical functions applicable to values include:

Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on numeric values.

Statistical functions: Functions like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation can be used to analyze numerical data.

Data type conversions: Values can be converted between different data types, such as strings, integers, and floats.

Vectors: Vectors represent ordered sequences of elements. Common mathematical functions applicable to vectors include:

Element-wise operations: Arithmetic operations can be performed on corresponding elements of two vectors.

Dot product: The dot product computes the similarity between two vectors.

Cross product: The cross product is defined for three-dimensional vectors and calculates a vector perpendicular to the two input vectors.

Vector norm: The vector norm measures the magnitude or length of a vector.

Matrices: Matrices represent rectangular arrays of numbers. Common mathematical functions applicable to matrices include:

Matrix addition and subtraction: Matrices with the same dimensions can be added or subtracted element-wise.

Matrix multiplication: Matrices can be multiplied, resulting in a new matrix.

Matrix transpose: The matrix transpose swaps the rows and columns of a matrix.

Matrix inversion: The matrix inverse, if it exists, computes the matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, gives the identity matrix.

# let's consider some common math functions that might be needed for processing keys, values, vectors, and matrices.
# Bit manipulation functions are often used for low-level programming tasks, such as packing and unpacking data structures, and
# performing efficient bit-level operations. While relational databases are not designed for storing and manipulating binary data,
# some bit manipulation functions can be useful for processing key-value pairs, vectors, and matrices.
# For instance, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations can be used to perform logical operations on binary data.

def bitwise_and(blob1, blob2):
    # Convert the BLOBs to byte arrays
    byte_array1 = bytearray(blob1)
    byte_array2 = bytearray(blob2)

    # Perform the bitwise AND operation on the byte arrays
    result_byte_array = bytearray(len(byte_array1))
    for i in range(len(byte_array1)):
        result_byte_array[i] = byte_array1[i] & byte_array2[i]

    # Convert the result byte array to a BLOB
    result_blob = bytes(result_byte_array)

    return result_blob

String manipulation: Functions for manipulating strings, such as length(), substring(), and to_lowercase().
Hashing: Functions for hashing strings to integers, such as MD5() or SHA-256().
Encoding: Functions for encoding strings into other representations, such as base64_encode() or hexencode().
Values:

Arithmetic: Functions for basic arithmetic operations, such as add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide().
Comparison: Functions for comparing values, such as equal(), greater_than(), and less_than().
Statistical: Functions for calculating statistical measures, such as mean(), median(), and standard_deviation().
Vectors:

Dot product: Calculates the dot product of two vectors.
Cross product: Calculates the cross product of two vectors.
Magnitude: Calculates the magnitude of a vector.
Normalization: Normalizes a vector to have a magnitude of 1.
Distance: Calculates the distance between two vectors.
Matrices:

Multiplication: Multiplies two matrices.
Transpose: Transposes a matrix, swapping its rows and columns.
Inverse: Calculates the inverse of a matrix.
Determinant: Calculates the determinant of a matrix.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: Calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
Bit manipulation:

# For example, here's a SQL UDF for calculating the dot product of two vectors:
```
CREATE FUNCTION dot_product(vector1 BLOB, vector2 BLOB)
RETURNS REAL
BEGIN
  DECLARE vector1_array BLOB;
  DECLARE vector2_array BLOB;
  DECLARE dot_product REAL;
  DECLARE i INTEGER;

  -- Convert vectors to bytearrays
  SELECT vector1 INTO vector1_array;
  SELECT vector2 INTO vector2_array;

  -- Initialize dot product
  SET dot_product = 0;

  -- Loop through corresponding elements and multiply
  FOR i FROM 0 TO LENGTH(vector1_array) - 1 DO
    SELECT vector1_array[i] * vector2_array[i] INTO dot_product;
  END FOR;

  -- Return dot product
  RETURN dot_product;
END;```
