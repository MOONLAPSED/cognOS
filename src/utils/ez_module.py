"""
A) The "default" list of elemental operations provided in the README.md file. This list covers various mathematical concepts and operations, such as arithmetic operations, logical foundations, set operations, and more.
B) Any additional arguments or configurations provided to the "curry" script. This could include options to generate specific elemental operations, customize the behavior or logic of certain operations, or specify additional parameters or configurations for the generated modules.
By following this approach, your "curry" script would generate concrete modules under a directory like ~/app/concrete/, with each module representing a specific elemental operation. The naming convention concrete_<operation_name>.py is a sensible choice, as it clearly identifies the module as a concrete implementation and associates it with the corresponding elemental operation.
For example, assuming you have a list of elemental operations like ["addition", "set_operations", "and_operator"], your "curry" script would generate the following concrete modules:

~/app/concrete/concrete_addition.py
~/app/concrete/concrete_set_operations.py
~/app/concrete/concrete_and_operator.py

Each of these modules would contain a concrete class that inherits from the ElementalOp base class (or any other relevant base classes) and implements the specific logic and behavior for that elemental operation.
By generating the concrete modules at runtime, you gain flexibility and extensibility. You can easily modify the list of elemental operations, add or remove operations, or change the behavior of existing operations by updating the "curry" script or providing additional arguments or configurations.
