# Qubit Representation and Invariance

## Compact Representation

### Bloch Sphere Mapping

We can represent a qubit state using a single byte (8 bits), mapping it to a point on the Bloch sphere:

- 0-255 → 0-2π for θ (polar angle)
- φ (azimuthal angle) fixed at 0 for simplicity

This gives us:
α = cos(θ/2)
β = sin(θ/2)

Ensuring |α|² + |β|² = 1 by construction.

### Byte to State Conversion

```python
def byte_to_qubit_state(byte_value):
    theta = (byte_value / 255) * 2 * math.pi
    alpha = math.cos(theta/2)
    beta = math.sin(theta/2)
    return alpha, beta
```

## Invariances and Symmetries

1. **Normalization Invariance**: |α|² + |β|² = 1 always holds
2. **Rotational Symmetry**: Rotations around the z-axis of the Bloch sphere
3. **Complementarity**: byte_value and (255 - byte_value) represent orthogonal states

## Update Rules and Invariance Preservation

### Normalized Update Rule

Modify Newton's method to preserve normalization:

```python
def normalized_update(x, F, F_prime):
    x_new = x - F(x) / F_prime(x)
    norm = math.sqrt(sum(abs(xi)**2 for xi in x_new))
    return tuple(xi / norm for xi in x_new)
```

### Bloch Sphere Constrained Updates

Perform updates directly on the byte representation:

```python
def bloch_update(byte_value, update_func):
    theta = (byte_value / 255) * 2 * math.pi
    theta_new = update_func(theta) % (2 * math.pi)
    return int((theta_new / (2 * math.pi)) * 255)
```

## Probabilistic Modeling

### State Evolution

Model the evolution of qubit states as a Markov chain on the discrete Bloch sphere representation.

### Measurement Process

```python
def measure(byte_value):
    alpha, beta = byte_to_qubit_state(byte_value)
    return 0 if random.random() < abs(alpha)**2 else 1
```

## Advanced Concepts

1. **Entanglement Representation**: Use two bytes to represent a pair of entangled qubits.
2. **Quantum Gates**: Implement common gates (H, X, Y, Z, CNOT) as operations on the byte representation.
3. **Error Correction**: Implement basic error correction codes using multiple byte-qubits.

## Mathematical Proofs

### Normalization Preservation

Prove that the normalized_update function preserves |α|² + |β|² = 1.

### Measurement Statistics

Show that repeated measurements of byte-qubits yield the correct probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩ states.

## Challenges and Future Work

1. Extend to multi-qubit systems efficiently.
2. Implement more complex quantum algorithms using this representation.
3. Analyze the trade-offs between this compact representation and full complex number representations.
4. Explore connections to quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

The compact byte representation is a novel approach that could lead to interesting optimizations in quantum simulation on classical hardware. However, it's important to note its limitations, especially when dealing with arbitrary superpositions and multi-qubit entanglement.
