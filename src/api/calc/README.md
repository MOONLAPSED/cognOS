# Qubit Representation and Invariance

## Compact Representation

### Bloch Sphere Mapping

We can represent a qubit state using a single byte (8 bits), mapping it to a point on the Bloch sphere:

- 0-255 → 0-2π for θ (polar angle)
- φ (azimuthal angle) fixed at 0 for simplicity

This gives us:
α = cos(θ/2)
β = sin(θ/2)

Ensuring |α|² + |β|² = 1 by construction.

### Byte to State Conversion

```python
def byte_to_qubit_state(byte_value):
    theta = (byte_value / 255) * 2 * math.pi
    alpha = math.cos(theta/2)
    beta = math.sin(theta/2)
    return alpha, beta
```

## Invariances and Symmetries

1. **Normalization Invariance**: |α|² + |β|² = 1 always holds
2. **Rotational Symmetry**: Rotations around the z-axis of the Bloch sphere
3. **Complementarity**: byte_value and (255 - byte_value) represent orthogonal states

## Update Rules and Invariance Preservation

### Normalized Update Rule

Modify Newton's method to preserve normalization:

```python
def normalized_update(x, F, F_prime):
    x_new = x - F(x) / F_prime(x)
    norm = math.sqrt(sum(abs(xi)**2 for xi in x_new))
    return tuple(xi / norm for xi in x_new)
```

### Bloch Sphere Constrained Updates

Perform updates directly on the byte representation:

```python
def bloch_update(byte_value, update_func):
    theta = (byte_value / 255) * 2 * math.pi
    theta_new = update_func(theta) % (2 * math.pi)
    return int((theta_new / (2 * math.pi)) * 255)
```

## Probabilistic Modeling

### State Evolution

Model the evolution of qubit states as a Markov chain on the discrete Bloch sphere representation.

### Measurement Process

```python
def measure(byte_value):
    alpha, beta = byte_to_qubit_state(byte_value)
    return 0 if random.random() < abs(alpha)**2 else 1
```

## Advanced Concepts

1. **Entanglement Representation**: Use two bytes to represent a pair of entangled qubits.
2. **Quantum Gates**: Implement common gates (H, X, Y, Z, CNOT) as operations on the byte representation.
3. **Error Correction**: Implement basic error correction codes using multiple byte-qubits.

## Mathematical Proofs

### Normalization Preservation

Prove that the normalized_update function preserves |α|² + |β|² = 1.

### Measurement Statistics

Show that repeated measurements of byte-qubits yield the correct probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩ states.

## Qubit Probability Amplitudes

A qubit state ∣ψ⟩∣ψ⟩ can be written as:
∣ψ⟩=α∣0⟩+β∣1⟩
∣ψ⟩=α∣0⟩+β∣1⟩

where αα and ββ are complex numbers and ∣α∣2+∣β∣2=1∣α∣2+∣β∣2=1.
Step 2: Measurement Probabilities

The probability of measuring the state ∣0⟩∣0⟩ is ∣α∣2∣α∣2, and the probability of measuring the state ∣1⟩∣1⟩ is ∣β∣2∣β∣2.
Step 3: Iterative Methods and Normalization

Define the iterative update rule using Newton's Method in lambda calculus:
xn+1=xn−F(xn)F′(xn)
xn+1​=xn​−F′(xn​)F(xn​)​

Ensure that each iteration maintains the normalization condition:
∣αn+1∣2+∣βn+1∣2=1
∣αn+1​∣2+∣βn+1​∣2=1
Step 4: Probabilistic Modeling

Use probability distributions to describe the initial state and the evolution of the qubit state. For example, if αα and ββ are initially uniformly distributed, show how they evolve under the update rules.
Step 5: Mathematical Proofs
Normalization Proof

Assume:
∣αn∣2+∣βn∣2=1
∣αn​∣2+∣βn​∣2=1

Prove:
∣αn+1∣2+∣βn+1∣2=1
∣αn+1​∣2+∣βn+1​∣2=1

given the update rules for αn+1αn+1​ and βn+1βn+1​.

Convergence Proof:

Show that the iterative method converges to a solution that satisfies F(x)=0F(x)=0 within the normalized qubit space.

## The Challenge:

Represent a qubit state as compactly as possible in a quantity-conserving, invariant way while still being able to represent the full state.

### Key Concepts

**Invariant**: The state of the qubit should remain unchanged by the application of the update rule. This implies that the state must be a normalized vector.

### Normalization Condition

To ensure invariance, the state must be a normalized vector. This means that the sum of the probabilities of measuring the state in any of its possible outcomes must equal 1.

For a qubit state \(|\psi\rangle\) represented as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
\]

The normalization condition is:
\[
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
\]

### Measurement Probabilities

The probability of measuring the state \(|0\rangle\) is \(|\alpha|^2\), and the probability of measuring the state \(|1\rangle\) is \(|\beta|^2\). These probabilities must sum to 1 to ensure the state is normalized.

### Update Rule

When applying an update rule, such as Newton's Method in lambda calculus, the state must remain normalized. This means that the update rule must preserve the normalization condition.

For example, if the update rule is:
\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{F(x_n)}{F'(x_n)}
\]

we need to ensure that after applying this rule, the new state \(|\psi_{n+1}\rangle\) still satisfies:
\[
|\alpha_{n+1}|^2 + |\beta_{n+1}|^2 = 1
\]

This ensures that the representation is invariant and quantity-conserving.


## Challenges and Future Work

1. Extend to multi-qubit systems efficiently.
2. Implement more complex quantum algorithms using this representation.
3. Analyze the trade-offs between this compact representation and full complex number representations.
4. Explore connections to quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

The compact byte representation is a novel approach that could lead to interesting optimizations in quantum simulation on classical hardware. However, it's important to note its limitations, especially when dealing with arbitrary superpositions and multi-qubit entanglement.
